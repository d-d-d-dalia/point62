    <h1>Why Kilometers</h1>
    <p>To date, the imperial system of measurement (think, miles, pounds, etc), is only used in 3 countries on the planet: Liberia, Myanmar, the United States, and the United Kingdom (though only for distance). Point62 aims to make it easier for mile-oriented people to get around all over the world, with a little less confusion and disorientation.</p>
